# 4Theta
Generalizing the Theta method for automatic forecasting

The original Theta model is generalized into a forecasting framework, called 4Theta, able to automatically extrapolate time series. Using elements and paradigms from the most successful ones in the past, we exploit the original principles of Theta to obtain robust predictions and expand its potential considering non-linear trend patterns, adjustments in trend intensity, as well as additive and multiplicative combinations of time series components. Thus, we end up with multiple models of different properties and select the best one for extrapolation using simple validation criteria.
